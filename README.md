# my_art_page

This is my attempt in web-development for my own small hobby that I practice, drawing.
Technically, this is a recreation of my carrd website, but hand-made, junky, and with less animations and other cool stuff. This is going to be potentially my window into software web-dev.

And I really need to make this one more responsive.
